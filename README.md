# Compatibility-Fix
Kotlin Android Plugin Fails to Instantiate KotlinAndroidTarget on Java 24 (Gradle 8.14 + AGP 8.6). Java 24 crypto features hack to work with latest android app builds
# Car Manufacturing and Customization Analogy

## Introduction

Building an Android app with Kotlin through Gradle can be understood through the following automotive manufacturing analogy:

## The Process

1. **Base Factory Setup (Gradle loads AGP)**
   
   Like how a general automotive factory installs specialized equipment for SUV production. This equipment provides the basic frameworks, molds, and assembly stations needed for any SUV (similar to how the Android plugin sets up project extensions and variant objects).

2. **Engine Specialization (Gradle applies Kotlin Plugin)**
   
   Then, the factory adds specialized equipment specifically for electric SUVs. This electric equipment must connect with the existing SUV assembly line - it wouldn't work if installed in a sedan factory (just as the Kotlin plugin expects Android plugin components to be available to create its KotlinAndroidTarget).

3. **Custom Features Workshop (Gradle's Object Decoration)**
   
   Finally, rather than using standard electric SUV parts directly, the factory runs them through a customization workshop that enhances each component with the car brand's signature features, premium interfaces, and smart connectivity options - while maintaining compatibility with the core electric SUV framework (similar to how Gradle decorates the KotlinAndroidTarget with DSL enhancements).

## Result

The result is a fully-featured electric SUV with premium customizations, just as your build produces a Kotlin-enabled Android app with all of Gradle's enhanced capabilities.
